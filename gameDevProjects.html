      <h3 class="fonth">Smoke Jumpers:</h3>
      <p class="font1">
          This is a game I made during a week break from school. It was an exercise in fully creating and 
          releasing a game from start to finish, and because it was done all within a one week time frame, 
          I made sure to keep the scope small. In Smoke Jumpers you are a wildland firefighter from the 1940s
          and you have to use the spacebar to dodge the fireballs for as long as possible!

      <h3 class="fonth">Unreal Landscape:</h3>
            <p class="font1">
                I made this landscape and water material in unreal engine 4.27 back in my first semester of college 
                at Southern New Hampshire University.

      <h3 class="fonth">3D Sword Model</h3>
      <p class="font1">
        This is a 3D model of a sword that I made for a class a couple years ago, 
        and refined and polished for my game capstone course. I used 3DS Max to
        create the 3D model, and one of the images is showing the model in Unreal 
        Engine 5. This is meant to highlight my skills as a 3D artist.
      </p>

      <p class="font1">
        When I reflect on this 3D model, I remember it taking a huge amount of time, 
        and many different iterations to get it right, compared to how easy it was to
        texture it and import it into Unreal Engine. It just goes to show how difficult
        3D art is. Kudos to you artists out there.
